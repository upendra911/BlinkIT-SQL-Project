This project simulates a retail sales environment for BlinkIT, where I built and analyzed a SQL Server database using real-world sales, items, and outlet data.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- SQL Server

- `scripts/`: SQL scripts to create and clean the database, plus analytical queries
- `BlinkIT_SQL_Case_Study.md`: Full walkthrough of the project and insights

## 📊 Key Features
- Designed 3-table relational model (`Sales`, `Items`, `Outlets`)
- Resolved data quality issues and enforced referential integrity
- Wrote advanced JOINs and analytical queries using GROUP BY, HAVING, RANK()

## 🔍 Sample Queries
